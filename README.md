# 3DPostProcessing
During my Internship with Bel Air Finishing I was responsible for Redesigning their 3D Post Processing Website and maintaining two other websites. This website was designed and coded by Peter Holyoke and I. During my time at Bel Air Finishing Pete and I had to design all the Wire-frames for this site and build it from the ground up. We also included a small Content Management System called Perch. This allowed people in the company who didn't know anything about websites to be able to add content to the Website with ease.
